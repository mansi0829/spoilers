# spoilers
Recently Peaky Blinder new season has come and my chrome is filled with its spoilers which is bad and again Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is coming soon and i don't want to spoil that so this chrome extension will help me survive through this XD

# Features

- **Spoiler Blocking**: Searches entire web page and replaces Spoilers with text `##[TEXT BLOCKED: SPOILER DETECTED]`
- **Image Blurring**: Blurs the neighbouring Images which are relevant and might reveal the Spoiler information.
